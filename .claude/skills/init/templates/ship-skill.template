# Ship Changes

Safely commit and push changes with proper validation and documentation updates.

## Pre-flight Checks

1. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   - If tests fail, STOP and report the failure
   - Do not proceed unless all tests pass

2. **Check Git Status**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   - Review staged and unstaged changes
   - Identify which files need to be committed

## Update Documentation

### Update CHANGELOG.md

1. Read current CHANGELOG.md
2. Ask user to describe the changes made
3. Categorize changes:
   - **Added**: New features
   - **Changed**: Changes to existing functionality
   - **Deprecated**: Soon-to-be removed features
   - **Removed**: Removed features
   - **Fixed**: Bug fixes
   - **Security**: Security improvements
4. Add entries under `[Unreleased]` section
5. Format: `- Brief description of change`

### Update TODO.md

1. Read current TODO.md
2. Ask user which tasks were completed
3. Move completed tasks from their current section to the `## Done` section
4. Add completion date: `- [x] Task description - YYYY-MM-DD`

## Stage Changes

**IMPORTANT**: Stage files by name, NEVER use `git add .` or `git add -A`

1. Review files to commit (from git status)
2. Exclude any sensitive files:
   - `*.pem`
   - `.env`
   - `*.key`
   - Credentials or secrets
3. Stage each file explicitly:
   ```bash
   git add file1.ts file2.ts CHANGELOG.md TODO.md
   ```

## Generate Commit Message

Use **Conventional Commits** format:

```
<type>: <short description>

<optional body>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Tests
- `chore`: Build, dependencies

**Example**:
```
feat: add user authentication

Implemented JWT-based authentication with login and registration endpoints.
Updated API to require auth tokens for protected routes.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

1. Analyze the staged changes
2. Review recent commits: `git log --oneline -5`
3. Draft appropriate commit message
4. Show message to user for approval

## Commit and Push

1. **Commit**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   feat: your commit message here

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

2. **Push**:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

   - If push fails, report the error
   - Common issues: need to pull first, no upstream branch

3. **Verify**:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   - Confirm push succeeded

## Summary

After successful ship:
- Tests passed ✓
- CHANGELOG.md updated ✓
- TODO.md updated ✓
- Changes committed ✓
- Changes pushed ✓

Report to user: commit SHA and files changed.

## Error Handling

- **Tests fail**: Report failures, do not commit
- **Sensitive files detected**: Warn user, exclude from staging
- **Push fails**: Provide git output and suggest fixes
- **Pre-commit hook fails**: Fix issues, create NEW commit (do not amend)
