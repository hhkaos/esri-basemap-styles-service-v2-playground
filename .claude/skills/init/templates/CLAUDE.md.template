- Testing: [Jest/Vitest/pytest/etc.]
- Build: [Vite/Webpack/etc.]

## Commands

```bash
# Installation
npm install

# Development
npm run dev          # Starts dev server on http://localhost:3000

# Tests
npm test             # Run all tests
npm run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode

# Lint
npm run lint

# Build
npm run build        # Output to dist/
```

## Architecture

[Description of your application architecture]

### Data Flow

```
User Input → [Component/Handler] → [Service/API] →
[Data Store] → [Response] → UI Update
```

## Git Conventions

**Conventional Commits**:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test additions/changes
- `chore:` - Build process, dependencies, etc.

**AI vs. Human Commits**:
- AI commits: `git cai "message"` (prefixes "AI: ", sets AI author)
- Human commits: `git ch "message"`

**Custom Skills**:
- `/ship` - Run tests, update CHANGELOG.md and TODO.md, stage changes, commit, and push
- `/release` - Create versioned release with changelog, git tag, and GitHub Release
- `/review-spec` - Review and refine project specification

**Documentation Maintenance**:
- When shipping, update CHANGELOG.md under [Unreleased]
- Mark completed items in TODO.md
- Update SPEC.md when requirements change

**Security Rules**:
- Never commit: `*.pem`, `.env`, private keys, API tokens, real user data
- Staging policy: Stage files by name - never `git add -A` or `git add .`

## Code Style

**General Principles**:
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments only for complex logic

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests for utilities and services
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Aim for 80%+ coverage

## Workflow Automation

**Pre-commit Hooks** (if using Husky):
```bash
# Runs on commit
npm run lint
npm test
```

**Pre-push Hooks**:
```bash
# Runs before push
npm run build
npm test
```
